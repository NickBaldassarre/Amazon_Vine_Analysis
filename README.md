* There were 1080 Vine reviews and 49673 non-Vine reviews.
* 454 Vine reviews were 5 star, and 23043 non-Vine reviews were 5 star.
* 42% of Vine reviews were 5 star, while 46% of non-Vine reviews were 5 star.
## Summary
This dataset suggests that there is no positivity bias for Vine reviews in comparison to non-Vine reviews. In fact, there was a slightly higher percentage of 5 star reviews among those that were non-Vine compared to those from Vine members. Furthermore, there are roughly 50 times more non-Vine reviews than Vine reviews, potentially giving the non-Vine review data a higher degree of reliability than the Vine review data.

Additional analysis that can be performed on this dataset could determine the percentage of total votes that are helpful votes, grouped by Vine and non-Vine reviews. A helpful vote for a review suggests that the review was well-received and resonated with the voter. Future research should compare the percentage of Vine votes that are helpful to the percentage of non-Vine votes that are helpful, in order to better understand the relationship between paid and unpaid reviews.
